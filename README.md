# Udacity class Intro to Parallel Programming by Nvidia
> CUDA GPU computing. This class talks lots about parallel algorithms but not much about the CUDA syntax. 
> The class is [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344) on Udacity website.
> 
> Class projects assignments are on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/cs344).
> 
> Here is my solutions for the first 4 projects (of total 6 projects).
> 
> Also check my basic CUDA code [here](https://github.com/lijiyao111/CUDA_C).
